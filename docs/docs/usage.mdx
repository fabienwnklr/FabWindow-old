# Usage

You can initialize the window simply as u see

```js
window.myModal = new FabWindow()
// Then access directly like this for example myModal.destroy()
```

## Fetch FabWindow instance

if you instantiate new FabWindow without store it into variables, you can fetch it easily.

```js
new FabWindow({ id: "myModal" })

const FabWindowInstance = document.getElementById("#myModal").FabWindow

FabWindowInstance.destroy()
```
